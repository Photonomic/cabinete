# Cabinete

Cabinete is a command-line tool for organizing photos (or other files) by creation date. It scans a specified directory, identifies the creation date of each file, and moves files into subdirectories named by the day of the month they were created (e.g., `01`, `02`, ... `31`). The tool provides a live interface that displays the directories being created, the number of files in each, and a progress counter of files processed versus remaining files.

## Features

- Organizes files by day of creation.
- Creates subdirectories for each day in the month.
- Provides a live interface to show the organization progress:
  - Displays the day directories and the total file count for each.
  - Shows a real-time counter for processed and pending files.
